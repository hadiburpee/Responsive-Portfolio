                <p>I was born in 1982 in Pasadena, California.  I am the second of five brothers.  I grew up in Glendale playing various sports through the end of high school.</p>

                <p>I attended UC Riverside where I majored in Economics.  After college, I worked in various industries, and finally settled in the niche area of tax called Indirect Taxes.  I am currently a Tax Manager at VCA Animal Hospitals, where I oversee the indirect tax function.</p>

                <p>Recreationally, I enjoy the usual, electronic music, hiking, videogames, going out, et cetera, and I've also produced music for hobby on my computer for the past 14 years.</p>
