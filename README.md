# Responsive-Portfolio

The goal of this assignment was to take the portfolio from week 1 and make it responsive to different screen sizes using media queries.  When making these adjustments, the main elements that I found to need adjustments were the margins for the header and box container, in addition to changing the location of the links on the screen.  There are 3 media queries and I adjusted everything to make it look like the pictures provided.

Thank you,
